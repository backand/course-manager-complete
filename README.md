# course-manager-complete

### Getting started

Install **node.js**. Then **gulp** and **bower** if you haven't yet.

    $ npm -g install gulp bower

After that, install angular-kickstart downloading the [master release](https://github.com/backand/angular-kickstart/archive/master.zip) (or clone the master branch if you want to run the development version). 

    $ git clone https://github.com/backand/course-manager-complete.git
    $ cd course-manager-complete
    $ cd skeleton
    
Install bower and npm dependencies, and run the application in development mode.

    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ gulp serve

You are now ready to go, your application is available at **http://127.0.0.1:3000**.

**Every file you add, edit or delete into the `/client` folder will be handled by the build system**.
